## Reach

"Reach" is a term commonly used in the Minecraft community to refer to a specific type of hack or modification that alters game mechanics to give players an unfair advantage in combat situations. Essentially, it extends the range of attacks so that players can hit enemies that would normally be out of range without the player having to manually intervene.

The term "reach" refers to the ability to perform attacks at a greater distance than normal. This allows players to hit enemies from a greater distance, resulting in a significant advantage in PvP battles.

The functionality of "Reach" generally involves modifying the game code to override the usual restrictions on attack range. This allows players to hit enemies with extremely high precision and attack from a greater distance. As a result, players can reach and attack enemies without putting themselves in danger, which can affect the fairness of the game.
